If you're starting a new project, try the `init` command:

```
$ modoc init [--path ./optional/path]
```

This will generate a sample project in the current directory (or you can provide an optional `--path`) to help you get started right away. You can also reference the [examples](./examples) directory if you want to create your own project manually.
